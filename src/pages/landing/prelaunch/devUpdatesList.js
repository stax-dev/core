          Our services don't just come with the hosting itself, as we aim to accomodate a smooth workflow with easy integrations and access.
          {" "}As mentioned with the upcoming AI assistant, we are adding emails, chats and features of a <b>Virtual Office</b>.
          <br/><br/>
          Furthermore, from the last update, our AI assistant now doesn't just chat with you. Say good morning to Staxle!{" "}
          Staxle now can carry out real operations and task like creating servers, updating details, manage your dashboard and many other real tasks!
